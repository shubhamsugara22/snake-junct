# Spec: Multiplayer Leaderboard Feature

## Status
ðŸ“‹ Draft - Not yet implemented

## Overview
Add a real-time leaderboard system that displays top scores with skill-adjusted rankings.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Display top 10 players globally
2. Show player's current rank
3. Update in real-time as scores are submitted
4. Skill-adjusted rankings (normalize scores by skill level)
5. Filter by difficulty level (easy/medium/hard)
6. Show player stats (score, skill level, games played)

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Leaderboard loads in < 500ms
2. Updates propagate within 2 seconds
3. Handle 1000+ concurrent players
4. Graceful degradation if server unavailable

## Design

### Data Model
```typescript
type LeaderboardEntry = {
  username: string;
  score: number;
  skillLevel: number;
  adjustedScore: number; // score * (1 + skillLevel)
  level: GameLevel;
  timestamp: number;
  gamesPlayed: number;
};
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/leaderboard?level=easy&limit=10` - Fetch leaderboard
